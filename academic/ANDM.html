          Cities in the world are facing the need to recover from COVID-19 and accelerate the transformation to greener spaces. Achieving global climate agendas, such as the Conference of Parties (COP), calls for national initiatives and the active contribution of cities. London, one of the global cities facing the risks of climate change, has a role to play in further accelerating climate action and leading the way for cities worldwide. 
          <br><br>
          This report aims to accelerate London's current decarbonization agenda by providing insight and innovative ideas from cities around the world on decarbonizing their energy infrastructure.

          Based on the information gathered from both primary and secondary research, the implementations of the models were assessed through the Five Case Model, providing a structure of thought and discipline for the assessment process. This helped arrive at critical and efficient decision making, which helped give insight into the feasibility of implementation to London.

        One of London's opportunities to complement its opportunities, such as the rapid expansion of EVs, is the availability of bi-directional charging. Bi-directional charging is the ability of an EV battery to receive energy and give energy. The rising numbers of electric vehicles are great news for decarbonising emissions within the city and creating opportunities to decarbonise the energy infrastructure.

        <p class="about__text">
          The personal carbon trading (PCT) model is an innovative and unparalleled policy tool to motivate the public to reduce greenhouse gas emissions using economic incentives and emission-related information. In 2020, the city of Lahti piloted its PCT model, which was the first city-wide project of its kind globally applied to the mobility sector. 
          <br>
          <br>
          London lacks a PCT system for mobility, focusing on carbon trading within the business sector; there are few incentives and reward mechanisms for individuals in the city to change their behaviour. This innovative PCT model can quickly be adopted in London due to its existing public transport and micro-mobility systems, such as Santander Cycles and E-scooters.

        <p class="about__text">
          •	London has the potential to further strengthen existing EV policies and accelerate decarbonization in the transport sector by utilizing the wide EV network and future increased number of battery degradation for promoting microgrids. However, the issue of shortage of physical space may persist and new spatial arrangements may be required in building EV microgrids, especially for a place for Vehicle-to-Vehicle charging and Vehicle-to-Storage charging.
          <br><br>
          •	The Personal Carbon Trading (PCT) model has the potential to promote community-level action in addition to facilitating micro mobility through engaging citizens in the city's decision-making agenda.
          <br><br>
          •	In the building sector, there is a lack of incentive to reduce energy consumption at the energy company or user level, and thus reduce carbon emissions beyond the minimum required level for a particular property.
