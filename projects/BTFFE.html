          <strong>Theme 1: The background of Tokyo's journey in the global financial arena</strong>
          <br><br>
          Global financial centres, including New York and London, are challenged by rising competition from cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles, reflecting a shift towards digital finance. Tokyo's decline on the global financial centre ranking prompts discussion on revitalisation through FinTech and government support. Despite setbacks, Japan remains optimistic, aiming for efficiency and innovation in its financial sector with a focus on internationalisation and FinTech development.

          <strong>Theme 3: The strengths and challenges of Japan to become a modern hub </strong>
          <br><br>
          Japan, with its significant history in the finance industry, can leverage its original strengths such as Government bonds, near-zero interest rates, and its dedication in regulation and trustworthiness. However, there remain hurdles to overcome such as slow decision-making processes, a culture of underselling, and the language barrier that needs to be addressed to unlock its full potential.

          <strong>Theme 4: Strategic recommendations to position Japan as a leading financial centre</strong>
          <br><br>
          Positioning Japan as a leading financial hub requires a strategic blueprint and the incorporation of successful use cases. Making Tokyo a starting point to execute the blueprint, Japan's unique culture and its dedication in technology and trustworthiness need to be integrated to embrace an inclusive approach to attract global talent and investments
