      <div class="about__container bd-nGrid">
        <p class="about__text">
          This report aims to analyze the main issues of Tramo 1 of the Tren Maya project in the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, by including a review of how municipalities located along the train route will be affected by its implementation and which opportunities the train can bring to those areas. 
          <br><br>
          After evaluating the existing assets of Tramo 1 within the adapted Sustainable Livelihood Framework, the paper concluded that the Tren Maya project is a crucial transforming process that has a great potential to reduce poverty by providing jobs, empowering local people, and developing tourism in those municipalities.       
          <br><br>
          The government’s role should not be neglected in intensifying opportunities that the Tren Maya can bring, which can be achieved by providing basic services and infrastructures and tourism marketing. In addition, that is the responsibility of the government to secure land tenures and intensify the simultaneous social programmes like Sembrando Vida to reduce poverty with combined solutions.

      <div class="about__container bd-nGrid">
        <p class="about__text">
          The four municipalities in Tramo 1 are significantly poorer than the national average poverty rate of 35%. The impoverished condition of people in Tramo 1 is also seen by the lack of access to basic services like sewerage, water provision, and electricity, compared to the national average. Many informal sectors characterize the economic condition in the Tramo 1 because the majority of them work in the agriculture sector and MSMEs.

        <p class="about__text">
          This research adapts the Sustainable Livelihood Framework by Department for International Development (DFID) (1999) to see how the Tren Maya supports poverty alleviation. The framework begins with the identification of vulnerability factors of the poor and what assets they have as a potential for poverty reduction. Besides, there is the transformation processes and structures that influence the livelihood strategies, such as how the poor manage their assets in order to achieve better living conditions. The transformation process is the implementation of the Tren Maya by the national government.
